# Bone-Break-Classification-Using-python-
This project focuses on classifying bone fractures from medical images (such as X-rays or CT scans) using machine learning &amp; deep learning techniques. The aim is to develop a predictive model that can accurately detect whether a bone is broken or not, based on image data.
